\section{Research Contribution}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Research Contribution}
My research area primarily has been in data mining and machine learning during Ph.D.  In the last two years, I have been working in the NLP, IR and IE domain. 
So far, I have worked on the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Anomaly Detection in Big Data (Ph.D. Topic) ({\bf ML, DM, Convex optimization})
\item Creative Tagline Generation for Product Advertisement (under IBM"s CFP entitled "Creative AI") ({\bf ML, DM, NLP, IE})
\item Prediction of Invoice Payment Status in Account Payable Business Process. (Client project) ({\bf ML })
\item Similarity Learning with Feedback for Invoice Line Item Matching (Client Project) ({\bf  ML, NLP})
\item  Automatic extraction of change configuration requests from email tickets (Current work with T-labs and TU Berlin) ({\bf NLP via DL, IE})
\end{itemize}
